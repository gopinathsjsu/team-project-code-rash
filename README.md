### Dynamic pricing strategy proposal 1:
1) There admin will login and set the current discount percentage like 10%, 20%
2) The rewards account will store the credits of the user. The credits will depend on past orders. Like 2 past orders will account for 20 points which means 10 per order.
3) The customer will select the base room like single room or double. Based on it the cost of double bedroom will be 40% more. So if single room is 100$, the double would be 140.
4) Then the add on costs are added. Like Swimming pool access would cost more. After adding these to base price the final price is determined.
5) A global list will store the seasonal discounts like christmas special discounts.
