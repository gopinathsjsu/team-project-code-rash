### XP Values followed
1. Communication
  - WhatsApp was used a primary source of our communication.
  - Everyone on our team worked jointly at every stage of the project to keep a track of our progress.
  - We conducted a weekly sprint once a week on Thursday to keep a track of the progress made until then.
  - During weekly sprints, we tried to identify our blockers and tried to remove them in the next sprint.
  - Our team followed a hybrid communication approach in conducting meetings such as in-person meetings and online meetings through Zoom.   

2. Feedback
  - Couple of minutes were reserved for feedback at the end of each sprint to discuss if any improvement was needed by a team member. 
  - We identified areas for improvement through constant feedback and revised the practices previously followed. 
   
3. Simplicity
  - We tried to keep the things simple and follow "to do only what is needed".
  - We also tried to minimize the wastage of time by doing only the absolute requirements stated in the problem statement.
