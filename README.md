2) The rewards account will store the credit points of the user. The rewards will be awarded once the stay is successful. Until then the rewards will be shown as pending rewards.
3) The customer will have the option to choose the type of room for stays.
4) The customer can also select amentities such as Continental Breakfast, Access to Swimming Pool / Jacuzzi, All meals included and many more during his/her stay.      After selecting the amenities, the final cost for the stay will be calculated.
5) A global list will store the seasonal discounts for different festivals and special events.
