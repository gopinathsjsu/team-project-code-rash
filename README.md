3) The customer will have the option to choose the type of room for stays.
4) The customer can also select amentities such as Continental Breakfast, Access to Swimming Pool / Jacuzzi, All meals included and many more during his/her stay.      After selecting the amenities, the final cost for the stay will be calculated.
5) A global list will store the seasonal discounts for different festivals and special events.
